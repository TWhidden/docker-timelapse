# Timelapse creator for Synology Surveillance Station

## Introduction
I set Surveillance Station to create a snaphot every 2 minutes. These snapshots are used by this Docker image to create a timelapse for the current day. So when you run this command each day at e.g. 23:59 you get a timelapse for the entire day.

To set-up Surveillance Station to automatically create snapshots, following these steps;
* Open `Action Rule`
* Press `Add` and name it something like `Timelapse`, set `Rule type` to `Triggered` and `Action type` to `Uninterruptable`
* Set the `interval` to 120 (seconds)
* Configure the event as follows (create one for each camera)
    * `Event source` -> Camera
    * `Device` -> Pick a camera
    * `Event` -> Connection normal
    * `Trigger type` -> Constant
* Configure the action as follows
    * `Action device` -> Camera
    * `Device` -> Pick a camera
    * `Action` -> Take snapshots
    * `Times` -> 1
* Configure the schedule as desired
* Check `Snapshot` to see the snapshots are actually created

## How to use

Use e.g. the Synology Cron to run this container at any prefered moment.

```
docker run \
    --rm
    -v $HOME/input:/input \
    -v $HOME/output:/output \
    erikdevries/timelapse \
    -f Xiaomi
    -d 1
    -f mp4
    -r 1080
```

In the above command a couple of things happen:
* `--rm` means the container is removed after it has run (otherwise each docker run will create, and keep a container)
* `-v [input]` mount a given `input` folder (e.g. /volume1/surveillance/@Snapshot)
* `-v [output]` mount a given `output` folder (where the create timelapse is stored)
* `erikdevries/timelapse` is the name of the image
* `-p Xiaomi` is the **prefix** for the filenames used to create the timelapse
* `-d 1` tells the application to create a timelapse with files from 1 **day** ago (optional, by default the current date is used, this is a number, so providing 14 means, create a timelapse with files from 2 weeks ago)
* `-f mp4` tells the application to output the timelapse in MP4 **format** (optional, mp4 by default, gif is the other option)
* `-r 1080` tell the application to **resize** the output to the given video width (optional, 720 by default, aspect ratio is preserved, for gif use something like 320 to keep the size down)

This Docker image assumes the following files exist: /input/[prefix]-[currentdate]-*.jpg

E.g. When prefix "Xiaomi" is provided, and the current year is 2018, month is march, day is 23, the following files should exist: /input/Xiaomi-20180323-[numbers].jpg

## Setup cronjob on Synology

* Open `Task Scheduler`
* Create a new task
    * `Task` -> Create Timelapse
    * `User` -> root (not prefered, but by default Synology does not allow other users to run Docker)
    * `Schedule` -> I use 00:05 to create a timelapse from the entire day before
    * `Run command` -> See the command below as an example

``
docker run --rm -v /volume1/surveillance/@Snapshot:/input -v /volume1/Video/Timelapse:/output erikdevries/timelapse -p Xiaomi -d 1
``

* Finally check that the timelapse is actually created (you can manually execute the created task)

## Additional tips

If you like to create timelapses for a range of X days in the past, you can use a simple bash script like the following. This example executes the command with 1 to 10 days in the past (so this results in several timelapses).

```
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10} do
    docker run --rm -v /volume1/surveillance/@Snapshot:/input -v /volume1/Video/Timelapse:/output erikdevries/timelapse -p Xiaomi -d $i
done
```
